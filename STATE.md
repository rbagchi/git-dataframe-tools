## Current State of Test Suite and Code Quality

**Goal:** Ensure a robust and maintainable test suite with high code quality.

**Progress:**
- **Centralized CLI Argument Parsing:** Common CLI arguments have been centralized into `src/git_dataframe_tools/cli/common_args.py`, and both `git_df.py` and `scoreboard.py` have been refactored to use these common definitions, improving consistency and reducing boilerplate.
- **Encapsulated Backend Selection:** The backend selection logic in `git2df/__init__.py` has been refactored to consistently pass `repo_path` to `GitCliBackend` and streamline the `get_raw_log_output` calls, improving modularity and consistency.
- **Decomposed `_walk_commits`:** The `_walk_commits` method in `src/git2df/dulwich_backend.py` has been decomposed into smaller, more focused functions (`_collect_and_filter_commits` and `_process_single_commit`), improving readability, testability, and maintainability.
- **Dulwich Backend Output Alignment:** Aligned the output format of `_format_commit_line` in `src/git2df/dulwich_backend.py` with the expected input format of `_parse_commit_metadata_line` in `src/git2df/git_parser.py`.
- **Accurate Additions/Deletions Calculation:** Implemented accurate calculation of additions and deletions in `_extract_file_changes` within `src/git2df/dulwich_backend.py` by parsing `dulwich.patch.write_tree_diff` output, replacing the previous hardcoded values. Updated relevant tests accordingly.
- **Runbook and README Tests:** `tests/test_runbook.py` and `tests/test_readme.py` have been refactored to be data-driven, extracting code blocks directly from `RUNBOOK-git2df.md` and `README.md` respectively. This ensures documentation stays in sync with the application's behavior. The tests now run in the current Python environment, simplifying execution and improving speed.
- **Flaky Test Resolution:** The flaky test in `tests/test_git_integration.py` was resolved by correctly managing the current working directory within the `git_repo` fixture.
- **Pytest Output:** Restored default, less verbose `pytest` output by removing `log_cli` configuration.
- **Dulwich Remote Backend Fix:** The `KeyError: b'HEAD'` in `tests/test_dulwich_remote.py` was fixed by refactoring `src/git2df/dulwich_backend.py` to correctly handle the temporary repository lifecycle during remote fetches.
- **Deprecated Dulwich API:** Updated `_create_dulwich_commit` in `tests/conftest.py` to use modern `dulwich` APIs, removing deprecation warnings.
- **Golden Files for Parser Tests:** Implemented a golden files approach for `tests/test_git2df_parser.py`, moving test data into external `.log` and `.json` files for improved readability and maintainability.
- **Refined CLI Testing Strategy:** Refactored `tests/test_git_df_cli.py` and `tests/test_scoreboard.py` to use a black-box testing approach. These tests now run CLI commands against real git repositories created by the `git_repo` fixture, removing brittle mocking and providing more robust validation.
- **Code Duplication Reduction:** Consolidated `sample_commits` data and the `extract_code_blocks` helper function into `tests/conftest.py`, improving code reuse and maintainability. The `tests` directory was made a Python package to facilitate cleaner imports.
- **`tqdm` Integration:** Added `tqdm` progress bars for Dulwich remote fetches and parsing, with determinate progress for parsing.
- **TTY Detection:** Implemented logic to disable `tqdm` progress bars when output is not to a TTY (checking `sys.stdout.isatty()`).
- **Color Output:** Disabled color output when not writing to a TTY.
- **Date Parsing:** Improved date parsing in `DulwichRemoteBackend` using `parsedatetime`.
- **Refactored `git_parser.py` for Robustness:**
    - Introduced `FileChange` and `GitLogEntry` dataclasses for structured data representation.
    - Modularized parsing logic with helper functions (`_parse_commit_metadata_line`, `_parse_file_stat_line`, `_process_raw_commit_block`).
    - Refactored `_parse_git_data_internal` to use these new helper functions and return `List[GitLogEntry]`.
- **Updated `dataframe_builder.py`:**
    - Modified `build_commits_df` to accept `List[GitLogEntry]`.
- **Migrated CLI to `Typer`:**
    - Refactored `git_df.py` and `scoreboard.py` from `argparse` to `Typer`.
    - Updated `pyproject.toml` to reflect the new `Typer` entry points.
- **Refactored `dulwich_backend.py`:**
    - Decomposed `_walk_commits` into smaller, more focused helper methods (`_filter_commits_by_date`, `_filter_commits_by_author_and_grep`, `_format_commit_line`).
- **Modularized `DulwichRemoteBackend`:** Extracted file change analysis logic into a new class, `DulwichDiffParser`, in `src/git2df/dulwich_diff_parser.py`. This significantly reduced the complexity of `DulwichRemoteBackend`.
- **Updated Tests:**
    - Split `tests/test_git2df_public_api.py` into multiple, more focused test files.
    - Updated various tests to align with `Typer` CLI structure and new data types.
    - Resolved all `ruff` linting and `mypy` type-checking issues.
- **Cyclomatic Complexity Analysis:** Performed `radon` analysis. The `DulwichRemoteBackend` class's complexity improved from 'B' to 'A'. The highly complex `_extract_file_changes` method (D grade) was successfully moved to `DulwichDiffParser.extract_file_changes`, where it retains its 'D' grade. The `DulwichDiffParser` class itself has a 'C' grade. Other functions with C or D grades remain:
    - `tests/test_git_df.py`: `test_git_extract_commits_basic` (D), `test_git_extract_commits_with_path_filter` (C), `test_git_extract_commits_with_author_filter` (C), `test_git_extract_commits_with_exclude_path_filter` (C)
    - `tests/test_git2df_integration.py`: `_parse_raw_git_log_for_comparison` (D)
    - `tests/test_git_integration.py`: `test_get_git_log_data_integration_default` (C)
    - `tests/test_git2df_backends.py`: `test_get_raw_log_output_with_filters` (C), `test_get_raw_log_output_with_exclude_paths` (C), `test_get_raw_log_output_with_merges` (C), `test_get_raw_log_output_with_paths` (C)
    - `tests/test_git_stats_pandas.py`: `test_get_author_stats_ranks_deciles` (C), `test_parse_git_log_multiple_commits_multiple_files` (C), `test_get_author_stats_basic` (C)
    Further refactoring, especially of `DulwichDiffParser.extract_file_changes`, will be considered to improve these grades.

**Commands Used for Running and Testing Code:**
- `uv run pytest`: To execute the test suite.
- `uv run ruff check .`: To check for linting issues.
- `uv run ruff check . --fix`: To automatically fix linting issues.
- `uv run mypy .`: To check for type-checking issues.
- `uv run black .`: To format the code.
- `uv pip install -e .`: To reinstall the project in editable mode after `pyproject.toml` changes.

**Current Blockers/Issues:**
- None. All tests are passing, and linting/type-checking issues are resolved.

Next Steps:
- Decouple `GitAnalysisConfig` from `GitPython`.

## Current Work: Resolving Test Failures After Dulwich Backend Refactoring

**Goal:** Ensure all tests pass after the refactoring of the Dulwich backend.

**Progress:**
- The `IndexError` encountered during `git-scoreboard` execution with `--remote-url` was identified as a typo in `src/git2df/dulwich/commit_formatter.py` and has been fixed.
- The `test_get_raw_log_output_basic_fetch` in `tests/test_git2df_dulwich_backend.py` was failing due to:
    - Incorrect `datetime` mocking: Resolved by patching `datetime` in `git2df.dulwich.date_utils`, `git2df.dulwich.commit_filters`, and `git2df.dulwich.commit_formatter`.
    - Missing file changes in test commits: Resolved by providing sample file changes when calling `_create_dulwich_commit` in the test.
    - Incorrect `expected_output` string: Resolved by updating the `expected_output` to accurately reflect the multi-line output format including both commits and their file changes.
- This test (`test_get_raw_log_output_basic_fetch`) is now passing.

**Remaining Test Failures:**

1.  **"Empty DataFrame" failures (GitPython backend parsing issues):**
    *   **Affected Tests:** Multiple tests in `tests/test_git_df.py`, `tests/test_git_df_cli.py`, `tests/test_git_integration.py`, `tests/test_scoreboard.py`.
    *   **Problem:** `get_commits_df` is returning an empty DataFrame. Debug logs show warnings from `git_parser.py` like "Could not find commit message delimiters" and "Could not parse commit date or timestamp". These tests use the `GitPython` backend.
    *   **Hypothesis:** The `git_parser.py` is not correctly parsing the raw log output generated by the `GitPython` backend, or the `GitPython` backend's output format has subtly changed or is not perfectly aligned with `git_parser.py`'s expectations.

2.  **`tests/test_scoreboard.py::test_main_author_and_me_mutually_exclusive`:**
    *   **Problem:** `ValueError: stderr not separately captured`. This occurs when accessing `result.stderr` from `click.testing.CliRunner.invoke`.
    *   **Hypothesis:** The `click.testing.CliRunner` might not be capturing `stderr` separately in the test environment, or there's a mismatch in how `stderr` is expected to be accessed.

**Approaches to Resolve Remaining Failures:**

**For "Empty DataFrame" failures:**

*   **Approach 1: Detailed Debugging of `GitPython` Output and `git_parser.py` Input.**
    *   **Action:** Add extensive debug logging to `GitCliBackend.get_raw_log_output` in `src/git2df/backends.py` to print the exact raw `git log` output. Also, add debug logging within `git_parser.py` (specifically in `_parse_commit_metadata_line` and `_parse_file_stat_line`) to inspect the input lines it receives.
    *   **Expected Outcome:** By comparing the raw output from `GitPython` with what `git_parser.py` is trying to parse, we can identify any discrepancies in the format (e.g., unexpected newlines, missing delimiters, different date formats) and pinpoint where the parsing logic needs adjustment.

*   **Approach 2: Review and Adjust `git_parser.py`'s Parsing Logic.**
    *   **Action:** Based on the debugging from Approach 1, refine the regex patterns and splitting logic in `_parse_commit_metadata_line` and `_parse_file_stat_line` in `src/git2df/git_parser.py`. Ensure they are robust enough to handle the actual output format produced by `GitPython` (which uses the `git log` command). This might involve making the regexes more flexible or adding alternative parsing paths for slightly different formats.

*   **Approach 3: Standardize `git log` format string.**
    *   **Action:** If there are irreconcilable differences in how `GitPython` and Dulwich produce `git log` output, consider if the `git log` format string used in `GitCliBackend` can be adjusted to be more universally parsable by `git_parser.py`, or if `git_parser.py` needs to be able to handle two distinct formats.

**For `ValueError: stderr not separately captured`:**

*   **Approach 1: Modify `click.testing.CliRunner` invocation.**
    *   **Action:** Investigate `click.testing.CliRunner` documentation for options to explicitly ensure `stderr` is captured. It might involve setting a specific parameter in `runner.invoke` or configuring the `CliRunner` instance.
    *   **Expected Outcome:** `result.stderr` should contain the error message, allowing the assertion to pass.

*   **Approach 2: Change the assertion target.**
    *   **Action:** If `result.stderr` cannot be reliably captured, change the assertion to check `result.output` (which combines stdout and stderr) for the error message.
    *   **Expected Outcome:** The test should pass if the error message is present in the combined output.

I will now proceed with addressing the "Empty DataFrame" failures by implementing Approach 1 (Detailed Debugging of `GitPython` Output and `git_parser.py` Input).
