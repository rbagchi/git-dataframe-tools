## Current State of Test Suite and Code Quality

**Goal:** Ensure a robust and maintainable test suite with high code quality.

**Progress:**
- **Centralized CLI Argument Parsing:** Common CLI arguments have been centralized into `src/git_dataframe_tools/cli/common_args.py`, and both `git_df.py` and `scoreboard.py` have been refactored to use these common definitions, improving consistency and reducing boilerplate.
- **Encapsulated Backend Selection:** The backend selection logic in `git2df/__init__.py` has been refactored to consistently pass `repo_path` to `GitCliBackend` and streamline the `get_raw_log_output` calls, improving modularity and consistency.
- **Decomposed `_walk_commits`:** The `_walk_commits` method in `src/git2df/dulwich_backend.py` has been decomposed into smaller, more focused functions (`_collect_and_filter_commits` and `_process_single_commit`), improving readability, testability, and maintainability.
- **Dulwich Backend Output Alignment:** Aligned the output format of `_format_commit_line` in `src/git2df/dulwich_backend.py` with the expected input format of `_parse_commit_metadata_line` in `src/git2df/git_parser.py`.
- **Accurate Additions/Deletions Calculation:** Implemented accurate calculation of additions and deletions in `_extract_file_changes` within `src/git2df/dulwich_backend.py` by parsing `dulwich.patch.write_tree_diff` output, replacing the previous hardcoded values. Updated relevant tests accordingly.
- **Runbook and README Tests:** `tests/test_runbook.py` and `tests/test_readme.py` have been refactored to be data-driven, extracting code blocks directly from `RUNBOOK-git2df.md` and `README.md` respectively. This ensures documentation stays in sync with the application's behavior. The tests now run in the current Python environment, simplifying execution and improving speed.
- **Flaky Test Resolution:** The flaky test in `tests/test_git_integration.py` was resolved by correctly managing the current working directory within the `git_repo` fixture.
- **Pytest Output:** Restored default, less verbose `pytest` output by removing `log_cli` configuration.
- **Dulwich Remote Backend Fix:** The `KeyError: b'HEAD'` in `tests/test_dulwich_remote.py` was fixed by refactoring `src/git2df/dulwich_backend.py` to correctly handle the temporary repository lifecycle during remote fetches.
- **Deprecated Dulwich API:** Updated `_create_dulwich_commit` in `tests/conftest.py` to use modern `dulwich` APIs, removing deprecation warnings.
- **Golden Files for Parser Tests:** Implemented a golden files approach for `tests/test_git2df_parser.py`, moving test data into external `.log` and `.json` files for improved readability and maintainability.
- **Refined CLI Testing Strategy:** Refactored `tests/test_git_df_cli.py` and `tests/test_scoreboard.py` to use a black-box testing approach. These tests now run CLI commands against real git repositories created by the `git_repo` fixture, removing brittle mocking and providing more robust validation.
- **Code Duplication Reduction:** Consolidated `sample_commits` data and the `extract_code_blocks` helper function into `tests/conftest.py`, improving code reuse and maintainability. The `tests` directory was made a Python package to facilitate cleaner imports.
- **`tqdm` Integration:** Added `tqdm` progress bars for Dulwich remote fetches and parsing, with determinate progress for parsing.
- **TTY Detection:** Implemented logic to disable `tqdm` progress bars when output is not to a TTY (checking `sys.stdout.isatty()`).
- **Color Output:** Disabled color output when not writing to a TTY.
- **Date Parsing:** Improved date parsing in `DulwichRemoteBackend` using `parsedatetime`.
- **Refactored `git_parser.py` for Robustness:**
    - Introduced `FileChange` and `GitLogEntry` dataclasses for structured data representation.
    - Modularized parsing logic with helper functions (`_parse_commit_metadata_line`, `_parse_file_stat_line`, `_process_raw_commit_block`).
    - Refactored `_parse_git_data_internal` to use these new helper functions and return `List[GitLogEntry]`.
- **Updated `dataframe_builder.py`:**
    - Modified `build_commits_df` to accept `List[GitLogEntry]`.
- **Migrated CLI to `Typer`:**
    - Refactored `git_df.py` and `scoreboard.py` from `argparse` to `Typer`.
    - Updated `pyproject.toml` to reflect the new `Typer` entry points.
- **Refactored `dulwich_backend.py`:**
    - Decomposed `_walk_commits` into smaller, more focused helper methods (`_filter_commits_by_date`, `_filter_commits_by_author_and_grep`, `_format_commit_line`).
- **Modularized `DulwichRemoteBackend`:** Extracted file change analysis logic into a new class, `DulwichDiffParser`, in `src/git2df/dulwich_diff_parser.py`. This significantly reduced the complexity of `DulwichRemoteBackend`.
- **Updated Tests:**
    - Split `tests/test_git2df_public_api.py` into multiple, more focused test files.
    - Updated various tests to align with `Typer` CLI structure and new data types.
    - Resolved all `ruff` linting and `mypy` type-checking issues.
- **Cyclomatic Complexity Analysis:** Performed `radon` analysis. The `DulwichRemoteBackend` class's complexity improved from 'B' to 'A'. The highly complex `_extract_file_changes` method (D grade) was successfully moved to `DulwichDiffParser.extract_file_changes`, where it retains its 'D' grade. The `DulwichDiffParser` class itself has a 'C' grade. Other functions with C or D grades remain:
    - `tests/test_git_df.py`: `test_git_extract_commits_basic` (D), `test_git_extract_commits_with_path_filter` (C), `test_git_extract_commits_with_author_filter` (C), `test_git_extract_commits_with_exclude_path_filter` (C)
    - `tests/test_git2df_integration.py`: `_parse_raw_git_log_for_comparison` (D)
    - `tests/test_git_integration.py`: `test_get_git_log_data_integration_default` (C)
    - `tests/test_git2df_backends.py`: `test_get_raw_log_output_with_filters` (C), `test_get_raw_log_output_with_exclude_paths` (C), `test_get_raw_log_output_with_merges` (C), `test_get_raw_log_output_with_paths` (C)
    - `tests/test_git_stats_pandas.py`: `test_get_author_stats_ranks_deciles` (C), `test_parse_git_log_multiple_commits_multiple_files` (C), `test_get_author_stats_basic` (C)
    Further refactoring, especially of `DulwichDiffParser.extract_file_changes`, will be considered to improve these grades.

**Commands Used for Running and Testing Code:**
- `uv run pytest`: To execute the test suite.
- `uv run ruff check .`: To check for linting issues.
- `uv run ruff check . --fix`: To automatically fix linting issues.
- `uv run mypy .`: To check for type-checking issues.
- `uv run black .`: To format the code.
- `uv pip install -e .`: To reinstall the project in editable mode after `pyproject.toml` changes.

**Current Blockers/Issues:**
- None. All tests are passing, and linting/type-checking issues are resolved.

Next Steps:
- Decouple `GitAnalysisConfig` from `GitPython`.
