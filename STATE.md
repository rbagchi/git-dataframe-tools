## Current Work: Making `git-scoreboard` Testable with Pytest

I am currently in the process of making the `git-scoreboard` project testable using `pytest`. This involves several key steps:

1.  **Refactoring `scoreboard.py`**: I have refactored core functions and methods that previously performed direct I/O (e.g., `print_error`) or exited the program (`sys.exit(1)`). These now raise exceptions (`ValueError`, `RuntimeError`) instead, allowing their behavior to be tested in isolation. The `main` function has been updated to catch and handle these exceptions gracefully.

2.  **Dependency Management**: `pytest` has been added as a development dependency, and `python-dateutil` (for accurate date arithmetic with `relativedelta`) has been added as a core dependency to `pyproject.toml` and `requirements.txt`.

3.  **Test Infrastructure**: A `tests/` directory has been created, and `tests/test_scoreboard.py`, `tests/test_git_interaction.py`, and `tests/test_git_integration.py` have been initialized. A `tests/RUNBOOK.md` has also been created to document the test suite.

4.  **Initial Test Development**: I have written unit tests for:
    *   `_parse_period_string` (to ensure correct parsing of natural language periods).
    *   `GitAnalysisConfig._get_date_range` (to verify date parsing, default period handling, and exception raising for invalid inputs).
    *   Comprehensive mocking of git interactions in `tests/test_git_interaction.py` for functions like `check_git_repo`, `GitAnalysisConfig._get_current_git_user`, `GitAnalysisConfig._get_main_branch`, `GitAnalysisConfig._estimate_commit_count`, `GitAnalysisConfig.get_git_log_data`, and `GitAnalysisConfig.get_commit_summary`.
    *   Initial integration tests in `tests/test_git_integration.py` for `check_git_repo`, `GitAnalysisConfig._get_current_git_user`, `GitAnalysisConfig._get_main_branch`, `GitAnalysisConfig._estimate_commit_count`, and `GitAnalysisConfig.get_git_log_data`.

5.  **Debugging and Refinement**: I am currently debugging failures in the integration tests (`tests/test_git_integration.py`). The unit tests (`tests/test_scoreboard.py` and `tests/test_git_interaction.py`) are currently passing.

### Current State of Tests (as of latest test run):

All unit and integration tests are passing. A new compatibility test (`tests/test_compatibility.py`) has been added and is also passing, ensuring that the original statistics module (`git_stats.py`) and the new Pandas-based statistics module (`git_stats_pandas.py`) produce identical output for the same input.

**Next Steps:**

Now that both implementations are verified to be compatible, the next step is to decide which implementation to use as the primary one, or to provide an option to switch between them.
