## Current State of Test Suite and Code Quality

**Goal:** Ensure a robust and maintainable test suite with high code quality.

**Progress:**
- **Runbook and README Tests:** `tests/test_runbook.py` and `tests/test_readme.py` have been refactored to be data-driven, extracting code blocks directly from `RUNBOOK-git2df.md` and `README.md` respectively. This ensures documentation stays in sync with the application's behavior. The tests now run in the current Python environment, simplifying execution and improving speed.
- **Flaky Test Resolution:** The flaky test in `tests/test_git_integration.py` was resolved by correctly managing the current working directory within the `git_repo` fixture.
- **Pytest Output:** Restored default, less verbose `pytest` output by removing `log_cli` configuration.
- **Dulwich Remote Backend Fix:** The `KeyError: b'HEAD'` in `tests/test_dulwich_remote.py` was fixed by refactoring `src/git2df/dulwich_backend.py` to correctly handle the temporary repository lifecycle during remote fetches.
- **Deprecated Dulwich API:** Updated `_create_dulwich_commit` in `tests/conftest.py` to use modern `dulwich` APIs, removing deprecation warnings.
- **Golden Files for Parser Tests:** Implemented a golden files approach for `tests/test_git2df_parser.py`, moving test data into external `.log` and `.json` files for improved readability and maintainability.
- **Refined CLI Testing Strategy:** Refactored `tests/test_git_df_cli.py` and `tests/test_scoreboard.py` to use a black-box testing approach. These tests now run CLI commands against real git repositories created by the `git_repo` fixture, removing brittle mocking and providing more robust validation.
- **Code Duplication Reduction:** Consolidated `sample_commits` data and the `extract_code_blocks` helper function into `tests/conftest.py`, improving code reuse and maintainability. The `tests` directory was made a Python package to facilitate cleaner imports.

**Current Blockers/Issues:**
- **Mypy Untyped Imports:** Remaining `mypy` errors are primarily `import-untyped` for `parsedatetime` and `pyarrow` due to missing type stubs that are not readily available. These are currently being tolerated.
- **Mypy Type Errors:** A few remaining `mypy` type errors need to be addressed.

**Next Steps:**
1.  Complete the `mypy` pass by addressing the remaining type errors.
2.  Complete the `ruff` pass by addressing any remaining linting issues.
3.  Complete the `black` pass to ensure consistent code formatting.
