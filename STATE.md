## Current State of Test Suite and Code Quality

**Goal:** Ensure a robust and maintainable test suite with high code quality.

**Progress:**
- **Runbook and README Tests:** `tests/test_runbook.py` and `tests/test_readme.py` have been refactored to be data-driven, extracting code blocks directly from `RUNBOOK-git2df.md` and `README.md` respectively. This ensures documentation stays in sync with the application's behavior. The tests now run in the current Python environment, simplifying execution and improving speed.
- **Flaky Test Resolution:** The flaky test in `tests/test_git_integration.py` was resolved by correctly managing the current working directory within the `git_repo` fixture.
- **Pytest Output:** Restored default, less verbose `pytest` output by removing `log_cli` configuration.
- **Dulwich Remote Backend Fix:** The `KeyError: b'HEAD'` in `tests/test_dulwich_remote.py` was fixed by refactoring `src/git2df/dulwich_backend.py` to correctly handle the temporary repository lifecycle during remote fetches.
- **Deprecated Dulwich API:** Updated `_create_dulwich_commit` in `tests/conftest.py` to use modern `dulwich` APIs, removing deprecation warnings.
- **Golden Files for Parser Tests:** Implemented a golden files approach for `tests/test_git2df_parser.py`, moving test data into external `.log` and `.json` files for improved readability and maintainability.
- **Refined CLI Testing Strategy:** Refactored `tests/test_git_df_cli.py` and `tests/test_scoreboard.py` to use a black-box testing approach. These tests now run CLI commands against real git repositories created by the `git_repo` fixture, removing brittle mocking and providing more robust validation.
- **Code Duplication Reduction:** Consolidated `sample_commits` data and the `extract_code_blocks` helper function into `tests/conftest.py`, improving code reuse and maintainability. The `tests` directory was made a Python package to facilitate cleaner imports.
- **`tqdm` Integration:** Added `tqdm` progress bars for Dulwich remote fetches and parsing, with determinate progress for parsing.
- **TTY Detection:** Implemented logic to disable `tqdm` progress bars when output is not to a TTY (checking `sys.stdout.isatty()`).
- **Color Output:** Disabled color output when not writing to a TTY.
- **Date Parsing:** Improved date parsing in `DulwichRemoteBackend` using `parsedatetime`.
- **Refactored `git_parser.py` for Robustness:**
    - Introduced `FileChange` and `GitLogEntry` dataclasses for structured data representation.
    - Modularized parsing logic with helper functions (`_parse_commit_metadata_line`, `_parse_file_stat_line`, `_process_raw_commit_block`).
    - Refactored `_parse_git_data_internal` to use these new helper functions and return `List[GitLogEntry]`.
- **Updated `dataframe_builder.py`:**
    - Modified `build_commits_df` to accept `List[GitLogEntry]`.
- **Migrated CLI to `Typer`:**
    - Refactored `git_df.py` and `scoreboard.py` from `argparse` to `Typer`.
    - Updated `pyproject.toml` to reflect the new `Typer` entry points.
- **Refactored `dulwich_backend.py`:**
    - Decomposed `_walk_commits` into smaller, more focused helper methods (`_filter_commits_by_date`, `_filter_commits_by_author_and_grep`, `_format_commit_line`).
- **Updated Tests:**
    - Split `tests/test_git2df_public_api.py` into multiple, more focused test files.
    - Updated various tests to align with `Typer` CLI structure and new data types.
    - Resolved all `ruff` linting and `mypy` type-checking issues.

**Commands Used for Running and Testing Code:**
- `uv run pytest`: To execute the test suite.
- `uv run ruff check .`: To check for linting issues.
- `uv run ruff check . --fix`: To automatically fix linting issues.
- `uv run mypy .`: To check for type-checking issues.
- `uv pip install -e .`: To reinstall the project in editable mode after `pyproject.toml` changes.

**Current Blockers/Issues:**
- None. All tests are passing, and linting/type-checking issues are resolved.

**Next Steps:**
- Refer to `CODE_IMPROVEMENTS.md` for further code quality improvements.
