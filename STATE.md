## Current State of Test Suite and Code Quality

**Goal:** Ensure a robust and maintainable test suite with high code quality.

**Progress:**
- **Runbook and README Tests:** `tests/test_runbook.py` and `tests/test_readme.py` have been refactored to be data-driven, extracting code blocks directly from `RUNBOOK-git2df.md` and `README.md` respectively. This ensures documentation stays in sync with the application's behavior. The tests now run in the current Python environment, simplifying execution and improving speed.
- **Flaky Test Resolution:** The flaky test in `tests/test_git_integration.py` was resolved by correctly managing the current working directory within the `git_repo` fixture.
- **Pytest Output:** Restored default, less verbose `pytest` output by removing `log_cli` configuration.
- **Dulwich Remote Backend Fix:** The `KeyError: b'HEAD'` in `tests/test_dulwich_remote.py` was fixed by refactoring `src/git2df/dulwich_backend.py` to correctly handle the temporary repository lifecycle during remote fetches.
- **Deprecated Dulwich API:** Updated `_create_dulwich_commit` in `tests/conftest.py` to use modern `dulwich` APIs, removing deprecation warnings.
- **Golden Files for Parser Tests:** Implemented a golden files approach for `tests/test_git2df_parser.py`, moving test data into external `.log` and `.json` files for improved readability and maintainability.
- **Refined CLI Testing Strategy:** Refactored `tests/test_git_df_cli.py` and `tests/test_scoreboard.py` to use a black-box testing approach. These tests now run CLI commands against real git repositories created by the `git_repo` fixture, removing brittle mocking and providing more robust validation.
- **Code Duplication Reduction:** Consolidated `sample_commits` data and the `extract_code_blocks` helper function into `tests/conftest.py`, improving code reuse and maintainability. The `tests` directory was made a Python package to facilitate cleaner imports.
- **`tqdm` Integration:** Added `tqdm` progress bars for Dulwich remote fetches and parsing, with determinate progress for parsing.
- **TTY Detection:** Implemented logic to disable `tqdm` progress bars when output is not to a TTY (checking `sys.stdout.isatty()`).
- **Color Output:** Disabled color output when not writing to a TTY.
- **Date Parsing:** Improved date parsing in `DulwichRemoteBackend` using `parsedatetime`.
- **Code Refactoring:** Decomposed `_walk_commits` in `dulwich_backend.py` into smaller helper methods (`_extract_commit_metadata`, `_extract_file_changes`).
- **Robust Git Log Parsing (Initial Step):** Started improving the robustness of `git log` parsing by changing delimiters from `---` to `@@@COMMIT@@@` and `@@@FIELD@@@`.

**Current Blockers/Issues:**
- **Test Failures due to Delimiter Change:** Many tests are failing because they are still expecting the old `---` delimited `git log` format, or asserting calls with the old format. This needs to be fixed by updating mock data and assertions in tests.

**Next Steps:**
1.  **Fix Test Failures:** Update mock data and assertions in `tests/test_git2df_parser.py` and `tests/test_git2df_public_api.py` to reflect the new `git log` delimiters.
2.  **Continue `git_parser.py` robustness:** Further enhance the parsing logic in `_parse_git_data_internal` to be more resilient to `git log` output variations.
