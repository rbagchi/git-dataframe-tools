## Current Progress and Further Improvements

### Progress on Existing Goals:

*   **1. Consolidate Git Repository Setup with a `pytest` Fixture:**
    *   **Achieved:** The `git_repo` fixture is used across multiple test files, including `tests/test_git_integration.py` and `tests/test_runbook.py`.
*   **2. Refactor `dulwich` Backend Tests to Use a Real Repository:**
    *   **Achieved:** The `dulwich_repo` fixture is used for `dulwich` tests.
*   **3. Address `test_dulwich_remote.py` Failure (Remote Fetch):**
    *   **Achieved:** The `KeyError: b'HEAD'` has been resolved by refactoring the `DulwichRemoteBackend`. The test is now enabled and passing.
*   **4. Address `DeprecationWarning: do_commit is deprecated`:**
    *   **Achieved:** The `_create_dulwich_commit` function in `tests/conftest.py` has been updated to use modern `dulwich` APIs.
*   **5. `test_runbook.py` and `test_readme.py` Improvements:**
    *   **Achieved:** `test_runbook.py` has been simplified to remove the slow and complex virtual environment creation. `test_readme.py` is now data-driven, executing the bash command examples from `README.md` to ensure documentation stays in sync with the application's behavior.

### Further Improvements and Actionable Steps:

1.  **Implement "Golden Files" for `test_git2df_parser.py`:**
    *   **Goal:** Improve the maintainability and readability of the parser tests by moving large, hardcoded test data into external files.
    *   **Detailed Steps:**
        1.  Create a `tests/data/` directory if it doesn't exist.
        2.  For each test case in `tests/test_git2df_parser.py`, create a pair of files:
            *   An input file with the raw git log (e.g., `tests/data/basic_commit.log`).
            *   An output file with the expected parsed data in JSON format (e.g., `tests/data/basic_commit.json`).
        3.  Create a `pytest` fixture that discovers these file pairs (e.g., by looking for all `.log` files and assuming a corresponding `.json` file).
        4.  Use `pytest.mark.parametrize` to decorate the parser test function. The test function will receive the paths to the input and output files.
        5.  In the test, read the input from the `.log` file, pass it to the parser, and then compare the JSON output of the parser with the content of the `.json` file.

2.  **Review and Refine Mocking Strategy for CLI and API Tests:**
    *   **Goal:** Reduce the complexity and brittleness of the CLI tests in `tests/test_git_df_cli.py` and `tests/test_scoreboard.py`.
    *   **Detailed Steps:**
        1.  **Adopt a Black-Box Testing Approach:** Instead of mocking internal functions, treat the CLI scripts as black boxes. The goal is to test the end-to-end behavior.
        2.  **Leverage `pytest-console-scripts`:** This `pytest` plugin can help capture the output (`stdout`, `stderr`) and exit codes of the CLI scripts without needing to mock `sys.argv`.
        3.  **Use Real Repositories:** For integration tests, use the `git_repo` fixture to create a temporary git repository with a known state.
        4.  **Refactoring `test_scoreboard.py`:**
            *   Instead of mocking `get_commits_df`, `parse_git_log`, etc., create a small, well-defined git repository using the `git_repo` fixture.
            *   Run the `git-scoreboard` command against this repository.
            *   Assert that the output printed to the console matches the expected ranking and statistics. The existing `test_scoreboard_with_df_path` test is a good model for this approach.
        5.  **Refactoring `test_git_df_cli.py`:**
            *   Similar to the scoreboard tests, use the `git_repo` fixture.
            *   Run the `git-df` command to generate a parquet file.
            *   Read the generated parquet file using `pandas.read_parquet` and assert that its contents are correct.
