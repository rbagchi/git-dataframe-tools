## Ideas to Resolve Failing Dulwich Backend Tests

This document outlines potential solutions for the failing tests in `tests/test_git2df_dulwich_backend.py`, where `DulwichRemoteBackend.get_raw_log_output` is not correctly populating the `output_lines` list.

1.  **Verify `Repo` object state after commit creation:** **VERIFIED.** Debug logs confirmed that `repo.head` correctly points to the latest commit, and `repo.get_walker()` yields all expected commits in reverse chronological order after each `_create_dulwich_commit` call in the test setup. This indicates the commit history is correctly formed in the `Repo` object used by the tests.

2.  **Explicitly pass `parents` to `dulwich.porcelain.commit`:** **FAILED.** Attempted to modify `_create_dulwich_commit` to accept and pass a `parents` argument to `dulwich.porcelain.commit`. This resulted in a `TypeError: commit() got an unexpected keyword argument 'parents'`. `dulwich.porcelain.commit` automatically infers parents from the current `HEAD`, so explicit passing is not supported at this level.

3.  **Inspect `Repo` object in `DulwichRemoteBackend`:** **VERIFIED.** Debug logs confirmed that the `Repo` object *inside* `DulwichRemoteBackend.get_raw_log_output` sees all expected commits in reverse chronological order. The previous issue of `output_lines` being empty was due to `list(repo.get_walker())` in a debug log consuming the iterator, leaving nothing for the main loop. After removing this, `output_lines` is now populated. The current failure is due to output format mismatch.

4.  **Simplify `dulwich_repo` fixture:** Temporarily modify `dulwich_repo` fixture to *not* create an initial commit. This would simplify the test setup to only the commits created within the test function, reducing potential interference.

5.  **Use `dulwich.walk.walk` directly:** Instead of `repo.get_walker()`, try using `dulwich.walk.walk(repo.object_store, [repo.head])` to explicitly walk from the HEAD. This might provide more control or reveal differences in behavior.

6.  **Check `dulwich` version compatibility:** Verify if the `dulwich` version being used has any known issues or breaking changes related to `get_walker()` or `Repo` object handling.

7.  **Isolate `get_raw_log_output` logic:** Create a new, minimal test file that directly calls `get_raw_log_output` with a manually created `Repo` object and commits, bypassing the `DulwichRemoteBackend` class entirely. This would isolate the problem to the `get_raw_log_output` method itself.

8.  **Review `dulwich` examples/documentation:** Search for official `dulwich` examples or documentation on how to correctly walk commit history in a local repository, especially when commits are created programmatically.

9.  **Consider `dulwich`'s object store:** The `dulwich.diff_tree.tree_changes` function takes `repo.object_store`. Ensure that the `object_store` is correctly populated and accessible.

10. **Mock `dulwich.repo.Repo` in `DulwichRemoteBackend`:** Instead of using a real `Repo` object in `DulwichRemoteBackend` for local tests, mock the `Repo` object and its `get_walker()` method to return predefined commits. This would allow testing the logic of `get_raw_log_output` in isolation from `dulwich`'s behavior.
