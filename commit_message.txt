feat: Execute low-effort code improvements

This commit implements several low-effort tasks outlined in LOW_PLAN.md to improve code quality and robustness.

The following changes have been made:

- **Improved Date Parsing:** The `_parse_period_string` function in `config_models.py` has been updated to handle articles like "a" and "an" (e.g., "a month ago"). This makes the date parsing more flexible and user-friendly. Corresponding tests have been added to verify this functionality.

- **Robust Progress Bar:** The `dulwich_progress_callback` in `repo_handler.py` has been made more robust by adding a `try-except` block to handle potential errors during the parsing of progress messages. This prevents the application from crashing due to unexpected progress message formats.

- **Added Planning Documents:** `PLAN.md` has been added to document the codebase analysis rubric, and `LOW_PLAN.md` was created to track the execution of low-effort improvement tasks.
